## Building from source

Consider downloading a [pre-compiled mumax¬≥ binary](https://mumax.github.io/download.html).

If you want to compile nevertheless, 4 essential components will be required to build mumax¬≥: an ***NVIDIA driver***, ***Go***, ***CUDA*** and ***C***.

* *If they are not yet present on your system*: install them as detailed below.
* *If they are already installed*: check if they work correctly by running the *check* for each component written below.

<details><summary><b><i>Install an NVIDIA driver</i></b></summary>

* **Windows**: Find a suitable driver [here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/).
* **Linux**: [Install the NVIDIA proprietary driver](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/unix/). <!-- version 440.44 recommended --><details><summary>Troubleshooting Linux &rarr;click here&larr;</summary>
  If the following error occurs, proceed as follows:

  ```batch
  nvidia-smi has failed because it couldn't communicate with the NVIDIA driver. Make sure that the latest NVIDIA driver is installed and running
  ```

  1) Check for existing NVIDIA drivers.
      * Run `dpkg -l | grep nvidia` to see if any NVIDIA drivers are installed.
      * If it shows some drivers, you might want to uninstall them before proceeding with the clean installation: `sudo apt-get --purge remove '*nvidia*'`
  2) Update system packages. Make sure your system is up to date with `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade`.
  3) (Optional but recommended:) Add the official NVIDIA PPA to ensure you have access to the latest NVIDIA drivers with `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa` and `sudo apt update`.
  4) Install the recommended driver. Ubuntu can automatically detect and recommend the right NVIDIA driver for your system with the command `ubuntu-drivers devices`. This will list the available drivers for your GPU and mark the recommended one. <br> To install the recommended NVIDIA driver, use `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-<version>` (replace `<version>` with the number of the recommended driver e.g., nvidia-driver-535)
  5) Reboot your system with `sudo reboot` to apply the changes.

  6) Verify the installation with `nvidia-smi`. This returns something like this, which shows you the driver version in the top center:

* **WSL**: Follow the instructions and troubleshooting for Linux above. If you encounter issues/errors during that process, see the troubleshooting section below: <details><summary>Troubleshooting WSL &rarr;click here&larr;</summary>
    When using Windows Subsystem for Linux, your graphics card might not be recognized. If an error occurs after running the command:

    1) If `ubuntu-drivers devices` throws the error
        * `Command 'ubuntu-drivers' not found`: run the command `sudo apt install ubuntu-drivers-common`.
        * `ERROR:root:aplay command not found`: run the command `sudo apt install alsa-utils`.
    2) If `sudo apt install nvidia-driver-<version>` throws the error `E: Unable to locate package nvidia-driver-<version>`: run the commands

        ```bash
        sudo apt install software-properties-gtk
        sudo add-apt-repository universe
        sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install nvidia-driver-<version> 
        ```

    3) If `nvidia-smi` throws the error `nvidia: command not found`: the controller is probably not using the correct interface (`sudo lshw -c display` should show NVIDIA). To solve this, follow [these steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gpu-compute). If a `docker: permission denied` error occurs: close and re-open WSL.

üëâ *Check NVIDIA driver installation with: `nvidia-smi`*

</details>

<details><summary><b><i>Install CUDA</i></b> - ‚ö†Ô∏èInstall in a directory without spaces‚ö†Ô∏è</summary>

* **Windows**: Download an installer from [the CUDA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è **To avoid common issues, the installation directory should not contain spaces. If possible, install in `C:\cuda`.** Spaces should not cause issues when running `deploy_windows.ps1`, but this is not guaranteed.
* **Linux**: Use `sudo apt-get install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`, or [download an installer](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
  * Pick the default installation path. **If this is not `usr/local/cuda/`, create a symlink to that path.**
  * Match the version shown in your driver (see top right in `nvidia-smi` output).
  * When prompted what to install: do not install the driver again, only the CUDA toolkit.
  * Add the CUDA `bin` and `lib64` paths to your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` by adding the following lines at the end of your shell profile file (usually `.bashrc` for Bash):

    ```bash
    export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

    Apply the changes with `source ~/.bashrc`.

üëâ *Check CUDA installation with: `nvcc --version`*

<details><summary><b><i>Install Go</i></b></summary>

* Download and install from [the Go website](https://go.dev/doc/install).
* The `GOPATH` environment variable should have been set automatically (note: the folder it points to probably doesn't exist yet).<br>*Check with `go env GOPATH`.* <details><summary><i>Click here to set `GOPATH` manually if it does not exist.</i></summary>
  * On **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%/go` is often used, e.g. `C:/Users/<name>/go`. See [this guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-PATH-Environment-Variable-on-Windows) if you are unfamiliar with environment variables.
  * On **Linux:** `~/go` is often used. Open or create the `~/.bashrc` file and add the following lines.

    ```bash
    export GOPATH=$HOME/go
    export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
    ```

    After editing the file, apply the changes by running `source ~/.bashrc`.
    </details>

üëâ *Check Go installation with: `go version`*

</details>

<details><summary><b><i>Install a C compiler</i></b></summary>

* **Linux:** `sudo apt-get install gcc`
  * ‚ö†Ô∏è each CUDA version has a maximum supported `gcc` version. [This StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46380601) lists the maximum supported `gcc` version for each CUDA version. If necessary, use `sudo apt-get install gcc-<min_version>` instead, with the appropriate `<min_version>`.
* **Windows:**
  * CUDA does not support the `gcc` compiler on Windows, so download and install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with the C/C++ extension pack. After installing, check if the path to `cl.exe` was added to your `PATH` environment variable. If not, add it manually, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.29.30133\bin\HostX64\x64`.
  * To compile Go, on the other hand, `gcc` is needed. Usually this is included in the Go installation, but if not it can be downloaded and installed from [w64devkit](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit/releases).

üëâ *Check C installation with: `gcc --version` on Linux and `where.exe cl.exe` on Windows.*

With these tools installed, you can build mumax¬≥ yourself.

* Within your `GOPATH` folder, create the subfolders `src/github.com/mumax`.
* Clone the GitHub repository by running `git clone https://github.com/mumax/3.git` in that newly created `mumax` folder.
  * If you don't have git, you can manually fetch the source [here](https://github.com/mumax/3/releases) and unzip it into `$GOPATH/src/github.com/mumax/3`.
* Initialize a Go module by moving to the newly created folder with `cd 3/` and running `go mod init github.com/mumax/3`, followed by `go mod tidy`.
* Query the compute capability of your GPU using the command `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=compute_cap --format=csv`. Based on this, set the environment variable `CUDA_CC`: if your compute capability is e.g., 8.9, then set the value `CUDA_CC=89`.
* You can now compile mumax¬≥ ...
  * ... **on Linux:**

    ```bash
    make realclean
    make
    ```

    Your binary is now at `$GOPATH/bin/mumax3`.

    Note: each CUDA version has a maximum supported GCC version. If your default GCC compiler is too recent, you can use a different GCC compiler by instead running `make NVCC_CCBIN=<path_to_gcc>` where `<path_to_gcc>` is a less recent GCC. [Check the version compatibility here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/46380601). Alternatively, setting the `NVCC_CCBIN` environment variable achieves the same thing, allowing you to run `make` as usual.

  * ... **on Windows:**
    The `Makefile`s may experience issues with whitespaces. Instead, we recommend to use the `deploy/deploy_windows.ps1` script: this generates the Windows executables for the [mumax¬≥ download page](https://mumax.github.io/download.html), but can also be used to build a single mumax¬≥ executable for yourself by making the following adjustments:
    1) Change the `$VS2022` variable to point to your Visual Studio executable. If you wish to compile for CUDA versions below v11.6, also set `$VS2017`. Example: if `where.exe cl.exe` returns `foo\bar\cl.exe`, then set `$VS2022 = "foo\bar"`.
    2) (Not strictly necessary, but check this anyway) Throughout the file there are several `switch ( $CUDA_VERSION )` blocks. If these do not address your installed CUDA version, add your version. Consult nearby comments when in doubt.

    Now you can compile mumax¬≥ by opening Powershell in the `/deploy` directory and running

    ```bat
    ./deploy_windows.ps1 -CUDA_VERSIONS <your_cuda_version> -CUDA_CC <your_compute_capability>
    ```

    where e.g. `<your_cuda_version>` is `12.6` and `<your_compute_capability>` is `86`, if you have installed CUDA v12.6 and your GPU's compute capability is 8.6.

    Your executable will be created in the `deploy/build` directory.

* *Check installation with: `which mumax3` on **Linux** or `where.exe mumax3.exe` on **Windows**, followed by `mumax3 -test`.* <details><summary>Troubleshooting: `cuda.h` or `curand.h` not found: &rarr;click here&larr;</summary>
  This usually means that the `CGO_CFLAGS` and `CGO_LDFLAGS` environment variables are not found or point to the wrong path. To fix this, either define them in the script you are using to build mumax¬≥, or define them in the terminal before running the script.
  * On **Windows:** say your CUDA is installed in `%CUDA_PATH%` (e.g. `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.1`), then run these two lines in Powershell before running `deploy_windows.ps1`:

    ```powershell
    $env:CGO_CFLAGS = '-I "%CUDA_PATH%\include"'
    $env:CGO_LDFLAGS = '-L "%CUDA_PATH%\lib\x64"
    ```

  If, during the build process of mumax¬≥, everything runs smoothly until you get the error that the `mumax3.exe` executable can not be found, try setting the `CGO_ENABLED` environment variable to `1` in your build script.
